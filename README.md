# SQLite
This task involves creating a tiny sales database using SQLite in Python.
Write and run SQL queries to summarize sales by product, showing total quantity and revenue.
Import query results into a pandas DataFrame for easy data handling.
Display the summary with print statements and visualize revenue per product using a simple Matplotlib bar chart.
Complete all steps in either a Jupyter Notebook or a Python script, with no extra downloads except basic Python libraries.
